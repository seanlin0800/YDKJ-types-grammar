# You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar
# Chapter 3: Natives

Several times in Chapters 1 and 2, we alluded to various built-ins, usually called "natives," like `String` and `Number`. Let's examine those in detail now.

Here's a list of the most commonly used natives:

* `String()`
* `Number()`
* `Boolean()`
* `Array()`
* `Object()`
* `Function()`
* `RegExp()`
* `Date()`
* `Error()`
* `Symbol()` -- added in ES6!

As you can see, these natives are actually built-in functions.

If you're coming to JS from a language like Java, JavaScript's `String()` will look like the `String(..)` constructor you're used to for creating string values. So, you'll quickly observe that you can do things like:

```js
var s = new String( "Hello World!" );

console.log( s.toString() ); // "Hello World!"
```

It *is* true that each of these natives can be used as a native constructor. But what's being constructed may be different than you think.

```js
var a = new String( "abc" );

typeof a; // "object" ... not "String"

a instanceof String; // true

Object.prototype.toString.call( a ); // "[object String]"
```

The result of the constructor form of value creation (`new String("abc")`) is an object wrapper around the primitive (`"abc"`) value.

Importantly, `typeof` shows that these objects are not their own special *types*, but more appropriately they are subtypes of the `object` type.

This object wrapper can further be observed with:

```js
console.log( a );
```

The output of that statement varies depending on your browser, as developer consoles are free to choose however they feel it's appropriate to serialize the object for developer inspection.

**Note:** At the time of writing, the latest Chrome prints something like this: `String {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c", length: 3, [[PrimitiveValue]]: "abc"}`. But older versions of Chrome used to just print this: `String {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c"}`. The latest Firefox currently prints `String ["a","b","c"]`, but used to print `"abc"` in italics, which was clickable to open the object inspector. Of course, these results are subject to rapid change and your experience may vary.

The point is, `new String("abc")` creates a string wrapper object around `"abc"`, not just the primitive `"abc"` value itself.
