## `try..finally`

You're probably familiar with how the `try..catch` block works. But have you ever stopped to consider the `finally` clause that can be paired with it? In fact, were you aware that `try` only requires either `catch` or `finally`, though both can be present if needed.

The code in the `finally` clause *always* runs (no matter what), and it always runs right after the `try` (and `catch` if present) finish, before any other code runs. In one sense, you can kind of think of the code in a `finally` clause as being in a callback function that will always be called regardless of how the rest of the block behaves.

So what happens if there's a `return` statement inside a `try` clause? It obviously will return a value, right? But does the calling code that receives that value run before or after the `finally`?

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( "Hello" );
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Hello
// 42
```

The `return 42` runs right away, which sets up the completion value from the `foo()` call. This action completes the `try` clause and the `finally` clause immediately runs next. Only then is the `foo()` function complete, so that its completion value is returned back for the `console.log(..)` statement to use.

The exact same behavior is true of a `throw` inside `try`:

```js
 function foo() {
	try {
		throw 42;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( "Hello" );
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Hello
// Uncaught Exception: 42
```

Now, if an exception is thrown (accidentally or intentionally) inside a `finally` clause, it will override as the primary completion of that function. If a previous `return` in the `try` block had set a completion value for the function, that value will be abandoned.

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		throw "Oops!";
	}

	console.log( "never runs" );
}

console.log( foo() );
// Uncaught Exception: Oops!
```

It shouldn't be surprising that other nonlinear control statements like `continue` and `break` exhibit similar behavior to `return` and `throw`:

```js
for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
	try {
		continue;
	}
	finally {
		console.log( i );
	}
}
// 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

The `console.log(i)` statement runs at the end of the loop iteration, which is caused by the `continue` statement. However, it still runs before the `i++` iteration update statement, which is why the values printed are `0..9` instead of `1..10`.

**Note:** ES6 adds a `yield` statement, in generators (see the *Async & Performance* title of this series) which in some ways can be seen as an intermediate `return` statement. However, unlike a `return`, a `yield` isn't complete until the generator is resumed, which means a `try { .. yield .. }` has not completed. So an attached `finally` clause will not run right after the `yield` like it does with `return`.

A `return` inside a `finally` has the special ability to override a previous `return` from the `try` or `catch` clause, but only if `return` is explicitly called:

```js
function foo() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// no `return ..` here, so no override
	}
}

function bar() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// override previous `return 42`
		return;
	}
}

function baz() {
	try {
		return 42;
	}
	finally {
		// override previous `return 42`
		return "Hello";
	}
}

foo();	// 42
bar();	// undefined
baz();	// "Hello"
```

Normally, the omission of `return` in a function is the same as `return;` or even `return undefined;`, but inside a `finally` block the omission of `return` does not act like an overriding `return undefined`; it just lets the previous `return` stand.

In fact, we can really up the craziness if we combine `finally` with labeled `break` (discussed earlier in the chapter):

```js
function foo() {
	bar: {
		try {
			return 42;
		}
		finally {
			// break out of `bar` labeled block
			break bar;
		}
	}

	console.log( "Crazy" );

	return "Hello";
}

console.log( foo() );
// Crazy
// Hello
```

But... don't do this. Seriously. Using a `finally` + labeled `break` to effectively cancel a `return` is doing your best to create the most confusing code possible. I'd wager no amount of comments will redeem this code.
