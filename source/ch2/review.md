## Review

In JavaScript, `array`s are simply numerically indexed collections of any value-type. `string`s are somewhat "`array`-like", but they have distinct behaviors and care must be taken if you want to treat them as `array`s. Numbers in JavaScript include both "integers" and floating-point values.

Several special values are defined within the primitive types.

The `null` type has just one value: `null`, and likewise the `undefined` type has just the `undefined` value. `undefined` is basically the default value in any variable or property if no other value is present. The `void` operator lets you create the `undefined` value from any other value.

`number`s include several special values, like `NaN` (supposedly "Not a Number", but really more appropriately "invalid number"); `+Infinity` and `-Infinity`; and `-0`.

Simple scalar primitives (`string`s, `number`s, etc.) are assigned/passed by value-copy, but compound values (`object`s, etc.) are assigned/passed by reference-copy. References are not like references/pointers in other languages -- they're never pointed at other variables/references, only at the underlying values.
