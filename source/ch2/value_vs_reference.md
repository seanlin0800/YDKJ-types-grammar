## Value vs. Reference

In many other languages, values can either be assigned/passed by value-copy or by reference-copy depending on the syntax you use.

For example, in C++ if you want to pass a `number` variable into a function and have that variable's value updated, you can declare the function parameter like `int& myNum`, and when you pass in a variable like `x`, `myNum` will be a **reference to `x`**; references are like a special form of pointers, where you obtain a pointer to another variable (like an *alias*). If you don't declare a reference parameter, the value passed in will *always* be copied, even if it's a complex object.

In JavaScript, there are no pointers, and references work a bit differently. You cannot have a reference from one JS variable to another variable. That's just not possible.

A reference in JS points at a (shared) **value**, so if you have 10 different references, they are all always distinct references to a single shared value; **none of them are references/pointers to each other.**

Moreover, in JavaScript, there are no syntactic hints that control value vs. reference assignment/passing. Instead, the *type* of the value *solely* controls whether that value will be assigned by value-copy or by reference-copy.

Let's illustrate:

```js
var a = 2;
var b = a; // `b` is always a copy of the value in `a`
b++;
a; // 2
b; // 3

var c = [1,2,3];
var d = c; // `d` is a reference to the shared `[1,2,3]` value
d.push( 4 );
c; // [1,2,3,4]
d; // [1,2,3,4]
```

Simple values (aka scalar primitives) are *always* assigned/passed by value-copy: `null`, `undefined`, `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and ES6's `symbol`.

Compound values -- `object`s (including `array`s, and all boxed object wrappers -- see Chapter 3) and `function`s -- *always* create a copy of the reference on assignment or passing.

In the above snippet, because `2` is a scalar primitive, `a` holds one initial copy of that value, and `b` is assigned another *copy* of the value. When changing `b`, you are in no way changing the value in `a`.

But **both `c` and `d`** are seperate references to the same shared value `[1,2,3]`, which is a compound value. It's important to note that neither `c` nor `d` more "owns" the `[1,2,3]` value -- both are just equal peer references to the value. So, when using either reference to modify (`.push(4)`) the actual shared `array` value itself, it's affecting just the one shared value, and both references will reference the newly modified value `[1,2,3,4]`.

Since references point to the values themselves and not to the variables, you cannot use one reference to change where another reference is pointed:

```js
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = a;
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [1,2,3]

// later
b = [4,5,6];
a; // [1,2,3]
b; // [4,5,6]
```

When we make the assignment `b = [4,5,6]`, we are doing absolutely nothing to affect *where* `a` is still referencing (`[1,2,3]`). To do that, `b` would have to be a pointer to `a` rather than a reference to the `array` -- but no such capability exists in JS!

The most common way such confusion happens is with function parameters:

```js
function foo(x) {
	x.push( 4 );
	x; // [1,2,3,4]

	// later
	x = [4,5,6];
	x.push( 7 );
	x; // [4,5,6,7]
}

var a = [1,2,3];

foo( a );

a; // [1,2,3,4]  not  [4,5,6,7]
```

When we pass in the argument `a`, it assigns a copy of the `a` reference to `x`. `x` and `a` are separate references pointing at the same `[1,2,3]` value. Now, inside the function, we can use that reference to mutate the value itself (`push(4)`). But when we make the assignment `x = [4,5,6]`, this is in no way affecting where the initial reference `a` is pointing -- still points at the (now modified) `[1,2,3,4]` value.

There is no way to use the `x` reference to change where `a` is pointing. We could only modify the contents of the shared value that both `a` and `x` are pointing to.

To accomplish changing `a` to have the `[4,5,6,7]` value contents, you can't create a new `array` and assign -- you must modify the existing `array` value:

```js
function foo(x) {
	x.push( 4 );
	x; // [1,2,3,4]

	// later
	x.length = 0; // empty existing array in-place
	x.push( 4, 5, 6, 7 );
	x; // [4,5,6,7]
}

var a = [1,2,3];

foo( a );

a; // [4,5,6,7]  not  [1,2,3,4]
```

As you can see, `x.length = 0` and `x.push(4,5,6,7)` were not creating a new `array`, but modifying the existing shared `array`. So of course, `a` references the new `[4,5,6,7]` contents.

Remember: you cannot directly control/override value-copy vs. reference -- those semantics are controlled entirely by the type of the underlying value.

To effectively pass a compound value (like an `array`) by value-copy, you need to manually make a copy of it, so that the reference passed doesn't still point to the original. For example:

```js
foo( a.slice() );
```

`slice(..)` with no parameters by default makes an entirely new (shallow) copy of the `array`. So, we pass in a reference only to the copied `array`, and thus `foo(..)` cannot affect the contents of `a`.

To do the reverse -- pass a scalar primitive value in a way where its value updates can be seen, kinda like a reference -- you have to wrap the value in another compound value (`object`, `array`, etc) that *can* be passed by reference-copy:

```js
function foo(wrapper) {
	wrapper.a = 42;
}

var obj = {
	a: 2
};

foo( obj );

obj.a; // 42
```

Here, `obj` acts as a wrapper for the scalar primitive property `a`. When passed to `foo(..)`, a copy of the `obj` reference is passed in and set to the `wrapper` parameter. We now can use the `wrapper` reference to access the shared object, and update its property. After the function finishes, `obj.a` will see the updated value `42`.

It may occur to you that if you wanted to pass in a reference to a scalar primitive value like `2`, you could just box the value in its `Number` object wrapper (see Chapter 3).

It *is* true a copy of the reference to this `Number` object *will* be passed to the function, but unfortunately, having a reference to the shared object is not going to give you the ability to modify the shared primitive value, like you may expect:

```js
function foo(x) {
	x = x + 1;
	x; // 3
}

var a = 2;
var b = new Number( a ); // or equivalently `Object(a)`

foo( b );
console.log( b ); // 2, not 3
```

The problem is that the underlying scalar primitive value is *not mutable* (same goes for `String` and `Boolean`). If a `Number` object holds the scalar primitive value `2`, that exact `Number` object can never be changed to hold another value; you can only create a whole new `Number` object with a different value.

When `x` is used in the expression `x + 1`, the underlying scalar primitive value `2` is unboxed (extracted) from the `Number` object automatically, so the line `x = x + 1` very subtly changes `x` from being a shared reference to the `Number` object, to just holding the scalar primitive value `3` as a result of the addition operation `2 + 1`. Therefore, `b` on the outside still references the original unmodified/immutable `Number` object holding the value `2`.

You *can* add properties on top of the `Number` object (just not change its inner primitive value), so you could exchange information indirectly via those additional properties.

This is not all that common, however; it probably would not be considered a good practice by most developers.

Instead of using the wrapper object `Number` in this way, it's probably much better to use the manual object wrapper (`obj`) approach in the earlier snippet. That's not to say that there's no clever uses for the boxed object wrappers like `Number` -- just that you should probably prefer the scalar primitive value form in most cases.

References are quite powerful, but sometimes they get in your way, and sometimes you need them where they don't exist. The only control you have over reference vs. value-copy behavior is the type of the value itself, so you must indirectly influence the assignment/passing behavior by which value types you choose to use.
