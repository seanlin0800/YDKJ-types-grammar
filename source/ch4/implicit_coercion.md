## Implicit Coercion

*Implicit* coercion refers to type conversions that are hidden, with non-obvious side-effects that implicitly occur from other actions. In other words, *implicit coercions* are any type conversions that aren't obvious (to you).

While it's clear what the goal of *explicit* coercion is (making code explicit and more understandable), it might be *too* obvious that *implicit* coercion has the opposite goal: making code harder to understand.

Taken at face value, I believe that's where much of the ire towards coercion comes from. The majority of complaints about "JavaScript coercion" are actually aimed (whether they realize it or not) at *implicit* coercion.

**Note:** Douglas Crockford, author of *"JavaScript: The Good Parts"*, has claimed in many conference talks and writings that JavaScript coercion should be avoided. But what he seems to mean is that *implicit* coercion is bad (in his opinion). However, if you read his own code, you'll find plenty of examples of coercion, both *implicit* and *explicit*! In truth, his angst seems to primarily be directed at the `==` operation, but as you'll see in this chapter, that's only part of the coercion mechanism.

So, **is implicit coercion** evil? Is it dangerous? Is it a flaw in JavaScript's design? Should we avoid it at all costs?

I bet most of you readers are inclined to enthusiastically cheer, "Yes!"

**Not so fast.** Hear me out.

Let's take a different perspective on what *implicit* coercion is, and can be, than just that it's "the opposite of the good explicit kind of coercion." That's far too narrow and misses an important nuance.

Let's define the goal of *implicit* coercion as: to reduce verbosity, boilerplate, and/or unnecessary implementation detail that clutters up our code with noise that distracts from the more important intent.

### Simplifying Implicitly

Before we even get to JavaScript, let me suggest something pseudo-code'ish from some theoretical strongly typed language to illustrate:

```js
SomeType x = SomeType( AnotherType( y ) )
```

In this example, I have some arbitrary type of value in `y` that I want to convert to the `SomeType` type. The problem is, this language can't go directly from whatever `y` currently is to `SomeType`. It needs an intermediate step, where it first converts to `AnotherType`, and then from `AnotherType` to `SomeType`.

Now, what if that language (or definition you could create yourself with the language) *did* just let you say:

```js
SomeType x = SomeType( y )
```

Wouldn't you generally agree that we simplified the type conversion here to reduce the unnecessary "noise" of the intermediate conversion step? I mean, is it *really* all that important, right here at this point in the code, to see and deal with the fact that `y` goes to `AnotherType` first before then going to `SomeType`?

Some would argue, at least in some circumstances, yes. But I think an equal argument can be made of many other circumstances that here, the simplification **actually aids in the readability of the code** by abstracting or hiding away such details, either in the language itself or in our own abstractions.

Undoubtedly, behind the scenes, somewhere, the intermediate conversion step is still happening. But if that detail is hidden from view here, we can just reason about getting `y` to type `SomeType` as an generic operation and hide the messy details.

While not a perfect analogy, what I'm going to argue throughout the rest of this chapter is that JS *implicit* coercion can be thought of as providing a similar aid to your code.

But, **and this is very important**, that is not an unbounded, absolute statement. There are definitely plenty of *evils* lurking around *implicit* coercion, that will harm your code much more than any potential readability improvements. Clearly, we have to learn how to avoid such constructs so we don't poison our code with all manner of bugs.

Many developers believe that if a mechanism can do some useful thing **A** but can also be abused or misused to do some awful thing **Z**, then we should throw out that mechanism altogether, just to be safe.

My encouragement to you is: don't settle for that. Don't "throw the baby out with the bathwater." Don't assume *implicit* coercion is all bad because all you think you've ever seen is its "bad parts." I think there are "good parts" here, and I want to help and inspire more of you to find and embrace them!

### Implicitly: Strings <--> Numbers

Earlier in this chapter, we explored *explicitly* coercing between `string` and `number` values. Now, let's explore the same task but with *implicit* coercion approaches. But before we do, we have to examine some nuances of operations that will *implicitly* force coercion.

The `+` operator is overloaded to serve the purposes of both `number` addition and `string` concatenation. So how does JS know which type of operation you want to use? Consider:

```js
var a = "42";
var b = "0";

var c = 42;
var d = 0;

a + b; // "420"
c + d; // 42
```

What's different that causes `"420"` vs `42`? It's a common misconception that the difference is whether one or both of the operands is a `string`, as that means `+` will assume `string` concatenation. While that's partially true, it's more complicated than that.

Consider:

```js
var a = [1,2];
var b = [3,4];

a + b; // "1,23,4"
```

Neither of these operands is a `string`, but clearly they were both coerced to `string`s and then the `string` concatenation kicked in. So what's really going on?

(**Warning:** deeply nitty gritty spec-speak coming, so skip the next two paragraphs if that intimidates you!)

-----

According to ES5 spec section 11.6.1, the `+` algorithm (when an `object` value is an operand) will concatenate if either operand is either already a `string`, or if the following steps produce a `string` representation. So, when `+` receives an `object` (including `array`) for either operand, it first calls the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation (section 9.1) on the value, which then calls the `[[DefaultValue]]` algorithm (section 8.12.8) with a context hint of `number`.

If you're paying close attention, you'll notice that this operation is now identical to how the `ToNumber` abstract operation handles `object`s (see the "`ToNumber`"" section earlier). The `valueOf()` operation on the `array` will fail to produce a simple primitive, so it then falls to a `toString()` representation. The two `array`s thus become `"1,2"` and `"3,4"`, respectively. Now, `+` concatenates the two `string`s as you'd normally expect: `"1,23,4"`.

-----

Let's set aside those messy details and go back to an earlier, simplified explanation: if either operand to `+` is a `string` (or becomes one with the above steps!), the operation will be `string` concatenation. Otherwise, it's always numeric addition.

**Note:** A commonly cited coercion gotcha is `[] + {}` vs. `{} + []`, as those two expressions result, respectively, in `"[object Object]"` and `0`. There's more to it, though, and we cover those details in "Blocks" in Chapter 5.

What's that mean for *implicit* coercion?

You can coerce a `number` to a `string` simply by "adding" the `number` and the `""` empty `string`:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = a + "";

b; // "42"
```

**Tip:** Numeric addition with the `+` operator is commutative, which means `2 + 3` is the same as `3 + 2`. String concatenation with `+` is obviously not generally commutative, **but** with the specific case of `""`, it's effectively commutative, as `a + ""` and `"" + a` will produce the same result.

It's extremely common/idiomatic to (*implicitly*) coerce `number` to `string` with a `+ ""` operation. In fact, interestingly, even some of the most vocal critics of *implicit* coercion still use that approach in their own code, instead of one of its *explicit* alternatives.

**I think this is a great example** of a useful form in *implicit* coercion, despite how frequently the mechanism gets criticized!

Comparing this *implicit* coercion of `a + ""` to our earlier example of `String(a)` *explicit* coercion, there's one additional quirk to be aware of. Because of how the `ToPrimitive` abstract operation works, `a + ""` invokes `valueOf()` on the `a` value, whose return value is then finally converted to a `string` via the internal `ToString` abstract operation. But `String(a)` just invokes `toString()` directly.

Both approaches ultimately result in a `string`, but if you're using an `object` instead of a regular primitive `number` value, you may not necessarily get the *same* `string` value!

Consider:

```js
var a = {
	valueOf: function() { return 42; },
	toString: function() { return 4; }
};

a + "";			// "42"

String( a );	// "4"
```

Generally, this sort of gotcha won't bite you unless you're really trying to create confusing data structures and operations, but you should be careful if you're defining both your own `valueOf()` and `toString()` methods for some `object`, as how you coerce the value could affect the outcome.

What about the other direction? How can we *implicitly coerce* from `string` to `number`?

```
var a = "3.14";
var b = a - 0;

b; // 3.14
```

The `-` operator is defined only for numeric subtraction, so `a - 0` forces `a`'s value to be coerced to a `number`. While far less common, `a * 1` or `a / 1` would accomplish the same result, as those operators are also only defined for numeric operations.

What about `object` values with the `-` operator? Similar story as for `+` above:

```js
var a = [3];
var b = [1];

a - b; // 2
```

Both `array` values have to become `number`s, but they end up first being coerced to `strings` (using the expected `toString()` serialization), and then are coerced to `number`s, for the `-` subtraction to perform on.

So, is *implicit* coercion of `string` and `number` values the ugly evil you've always heard horror stories about? I don't personally think so.

Compare `b = String(a)` (*explicit*) to `b = a + ""` (*implicit*). I think cases can be made for both approaches being useful in your code. Certainly `b = a + ""` is quite a bit more common in JS programs, proving its own utility regardless of *feelings* about the merits or hazards of *implicit* coercion in general.

### Implicitly: Booleans --> Numbers

I think a case where *implicit* coercion can really shine is in simplifying certain types of complicated `boolean` logic into simple numeric addition. Of course, this is not a general-purpose technique, but a specific solution for specific cases.

Consider:

```js
function onlyOne(a,b,c) {
	return !!((a && !b && !c) ||
		(!a && b && !c) || (!a && !b && c));
}

var a = true;
var b = false;

onlyOne( a, b, b );	// true
onlyOne( b, a, b );	// true

onlyOne( a, b, a );	// false
```

This `onlyOne(..)` utility should only return `true` if exactly one of the arguments is `true` / truthy. It's using *implicit* coercion on the truthy checks and *explicit* coercion on the others, including the final return value.

But what if we needed that utility to be able to handle four, five, or twenty flags in the same way? It's pretty difficult to imagine implementing code that would handle all those permutations of comparisons.

But here's where coercing the `boolean` values to `number`s (`0` or `1`, obviously) can greatly help:

```js
function onlyOne() {
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
		// skip falsy values. same as treating
		// them as 0's, but avoids NaN's.
		if (arguments[i]) {
			sum += arguments[i];
		}
	}
	return sum == 1;
}

var a = true;
var b = false;

onlyOne( b, a );				// true
onlyOne( b, a, b, b, b );		// true

onlyOne( b, b );				// false
onlyOne( b, a, b, b, b, a );	// false
```

**Note:** Of course, instead of the `for` loop in `onlyOne(..)`, you could more tersely use the ES5 `reduce(..)` utility, but I didn't want to obscure the concepts.

What we're doing here is relying on the `1` for `true`/truthy coercions, and numerically adding them all up. `sum += arguments[i]` uses *implicit* coercion to make that happen. If one and only one value in the `arguments` list is `true`, then the numeric sum will be `1`, otherwise the sum will not be `1` and thus the desired condition is not met.

We could of course do this with *explicit* coercion instead:

```js
function onlyOne() {
	var sum = 0;
	for (var i=0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
		sum += Number( !!arguments[i] );
	}
	return sum === 1;
}
```

We first use `!!arguments[i]` to force the coercion of the value to `true` or `false`. That's so you could pass non-`boolean` values in, like `onlyOne( "42", 0 )`, and it would still work as expected (otherwise you'd end up with `string` concatenation and the logic would be incorrect).

Once we're sure it's a `boolean`, we do another *explicit* coercion with `Number(..)` to make sure the value is `0` or `1`.

Is the *explicit* coercion form of this utility "better"? It does avoid the `NaN` trap as explained in the code comments. But, ultimately, it depends on your needs. I personally think the former version, relying on *implicit* coercion is more elegant (if you won't be passing `undefined` or `NaN`), and the *explicit* version is needlessly more verbose.

But as with almost everything we're discussing here, it's a judgment call.

**Note:** Regardless of *implicit* or *explicit* approaches, you could easily make `onlyTwo(..)` or `onlyFive(..)` variations by simply changing the final comparison from `1`, to `2` or `5`, respectively. That's drastically easier than adding a bunch of `&&` and `||` expressions. So, generally, coercion is very helpful in this case.

### Implicitly: * --> Boolean

Now, let's turn our attention to *implicit* coercion to `boolean` values, as it's by far the most common and also by far the most potentially troublesome.

Remember, *implicit* coercion is what kicks in when you use a value in such a way that it forces the value to be converted. For numeric and `string` operations, it's fairly easy to see how the coercions can occur.

But, what sort of expression operations require/force (*implicitly*) a `boolean` coercion?

1. The test expression in an `if (..)` statement.
2. The test expression (second clause) in a `for ( .. ; .. ; .. )` header.
3. The test expression in `while (..)` and `do..while(..)` loops.
4. The test expression (first clause) in `? :` ternary expressions.
5. The left-hand operand (which serves as a test expression -- see below!) to the `||` ("logical or") and `&&` ("logical and") operators.

Any value used in these contexts that is not already a `boolean` will be *implicitly* coerced to a `boolean` using the rules of the `ToBoolean` abstract operation covered earlier in this chapter.

Let's look at some examples:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "abc";
var c;
var d = null;

if (a) {
	console.log( "yep" );		// yep
}

while (c) {
	console.log( "nope, never runs" );
}

c = d ? a : b;
c;								// "abc"

if ((a && d) || c) {
	console.log( "yep" );		// yep
}
```

In all these contexts, the non-`boolean` values are *implicitly coerced* to their `boolean` equivalents to make the test decisions.

### Operators `||` and `&&`

It's quite likely that you have seen the `||` ("logical or") and `&&` ("logical and") operators in most or all other languages you've used. So it'd be natural to assume that they work basically the same in JavaScript as in other similar languages.

There's some very little known, but very important, nuance here.

In fact, I would argue these operators shouldn't even be called "logical ___ operators", as that name is incomplete in describing what they do. If I were to give them a more accurate (if more clumsy) name, I'd call them "selector operators," or more completely, "operand selector operators."

Why? Because they don't actually result in a *logic* value (aka `boolean`) in JavaScript, as they do in some other languages.

So what *do* they result in? They result in the value of one (and only one) of their two operands. In other words, **they select one of the two operand's values**.

Quoting the ES5 spec from section 11.11:

> The value produced by a && or || operator is not necessarily of type Boolean. The value produced will always be the value of one of the two operand expressions.

Let's illustrate:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = "abc";
var c = null;

a || b;		// 42
a && b;		// "abc"

c || b;		// "abc"
c && b;		// null
```

**Wait, what!?** Think about that. In languages like C and PHP, those expressions result in `true` or `false`, but in JS (and Python and Ruby, for that matter!), the result comes from the values themselves.

Both `||` and `&&` operators perform a `boolean` test on the **first operand** (`a` or `c`). If the operand is not already `boolean` (as it's not, here), a normal `ToBoolean` coercion occurs, so that the test can be performed.

For the `||` operator, if the test is `true`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *first operand* (`a` or `c`). If the test is `false`, the `||` expression results in the value of the *second operand* (`b`).

Inversely, for the `&&` operator, if the test is `true`, the `&&` expression results in the value of the *second operand* (`b`). If the test is `false`, the `&&` expression results in the value of the *first operand* (`a` or `c`).

The result of a `||` or `&&` expression is always the underlying value of one of the operands, **not** the (possibly coerced) result of the test. In `c && b`, `c` is `null`, and thus falsy. But the `&&` expression itself results in `null` (the value in `c`), not in the coerced `false` used in the test.

Do you see how these operators act as "operand selectors", now?

Another way of thinking about these operators:

```js
a || b;
// roughly equivalent to:
a ? a : b;

a && b;
// roughly equivalent to:
a ? b : a;
```

**Note:** I call `a || b` "roughly equivalent" to `a ? a : b` because the outcome is identical, but there's a nuanced difference. In `a ? a : b`, if `a` was a more complex expression (like for instance one that might have side effects like calling a `function`, etc.), then the `a` expression would possibly be evaluated twice (if the first evaluation was truthy). By contrast, for `a || b`, the `a` expression is evaluated only once, and that value is used both for the coercive test as well as the result value (if appropriate). The same nuance applies to the `a && b` and `a ? b : a` expressions.

An extremely common and helpful usage of this behavior, which there's a good chance you may have used before and not fully understood, is:

```js
function foo(a,b) {
	a = a || "hello";
	b = b || "world";

	console.log( a + " " + b );
}

foo();					// "hello world"
foo( "yeah", "yeah!" );	// "yeah yeah!"
```

The `a = a || "hello"` idiom (sometimes said to be JavaScript's version of the C# "null coallescing operator") acts to test `a` and if it has no value (or only an undesired falsy value), provides a backup default value (`"hello"`).

**Be careful**, though!

```js
foo( "That's it!", "" ); // "That's it! world" <-- Oops!
```

See the problem? `""` as the second argument is a falsy value (see `ToBoolean` earlier in this chapter), so the `b = b || "world"` test fails, and the `"world"` default value is substituted, even though the intent probably was to have the explicitly passed `""` be the value assigned to `b`.

This `||` idiom is extremely common, and quite helpful, but you have to use it only in cases where *all falsy values* should be skipped. Otherwise, you'll need to be more explicit in your test, and probably use a `? :` ternary instead.

This *default value assignment* idiom is so common (and useful!) that even those who publicly and vehemently decry JavaScript coercion often use it in their own code!

What about `&&`?

There's another idiom that is quite a bit less commonly authored manually, but which is used by JS minifiers frequently. The `&&` operator "selects" the second operand if and only if the first operand tests as truthy, and this usage is sometimes called the "guard operator" (also see "Short Circuited" in Chapter 5) -- the first expression test "guards" the second expression:

```js
function foo() {
	console.log( a );
}

var a = 42;

a && foo(); // 42
```

`foo()` gets called only because `a` tests as truthy. If that test failed, this `a && foo()` expression statement would just silently stop -- this is known as "short circuiting" -- and never call `foo()`.

Again, it's not nearly as common for people to author such things. Usually, they'd do `if (a) { foo(); }` instead. But JS minifiers choose `a && foo()` because it's much shorter. So, now, if you ever have to decipher such code, you'll know what it's doing and why.

OK, so `||` and `&&` have some neat tricks up their sleeve, as long as you're willing to allow the *implicit* coercion into the mix.

**Note:** Both the `a = b || "something"` and `a && b()` idioms rely on short circuiting behavior, which we cover in more detail in Chapter 5.

The fact that these operators don't actually result in `true` and `false` is possibly messing with your head a little bit by now. You're probably wondering how all your `if` statements and `for` loops have been working, if they've included compound logical expressions like `a && (b || c)`.

Don't worry! The sky is not falling. Your code is (probably) just fine. It's just that you probably never realized before that there was an *implicit* coercion to `boolean` going on **after** the compound expression was evaluated.

Consider:

```js
var a = 42;
var b = null;
var c = "foo";

if (a && (b || c)) {
	console.log( "yep" );
}
```

This code still works the way you always thought it did, except for one subtle extra detail. The `a && (b || c)` expression *actually* results in `"foo"`, not `true`. So, the `if` statement *then* forces the `"foo"` value to coerce to a `boolean`, which of course will be `true`.

See? No reason to panic. Your code is probably still safe. But now you know more about how it does what it does.

And now you also realize that such code is using *implicit* coercion. If you're in the "avoid (implicit) coercion camp" still, you're going to need to go back and make all of those tests *explicit*:

```js
if (!!a && (!!b || !!c)) {
	console.log( "yep" );
}
```

Good luck with that! ... Sorry, just teasing.

### Symbol Coercion

Up to this point, there's been almost no observable outcome difference between *explicit* and *implicit* coercion -- only the readability of code has been at stake.

But ES6 Symbols introduce a gotcha into the coercion system that we need to discuss briefly. For reasons that go well beyond the scope of what we'll discuss in this book, *explicit* coercion of a `symbol` to a `string` is allowed, but *implicit* coercion of the same is disallowed and throws an error.

Consider:

```js
var s1 = Symbol( "cool" );
String( s1 );					// "Symbol(cool)"

var s2 = Symbol( "not cool" );
s2 + "";						// TypeError
```

`symbol` values cannot coerce to `number` at all (throws an error either way), but strangely they can both *explicitly* and *implicitly* coerce to `boolean` (always `true`).

Consistency is always easier to learn, and exceptions are never fun to deal with, but we just need to be careful around the new ES6 `symbol` values and how we coerce them.

The good news: it's probably going to be exceedingly rare for you to need to coerce a `symbol` value. The way they're typically used (see Chapter 3) will probably not call for coercion on a normal basis.
